# cktAGT
This is a javascript implementation of an AGT that will be able to:
- create its own plugins to accomplish new tasks it encounters them and
- select optimal LLMs to use based on the Goal and Tasks

Much of this code remains untested and unproven.  Given the capabilities of the system,
it is theoretically possible the system will do things that aren't desirable especially if you
give it destructive prompts or allow it to build harmful code.

These are very early days.  The front-end is barebones.  Don't laugh at it.
