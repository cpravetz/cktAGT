# cktAGT
This is a javascript implementation of an AGT that will be able to:
- create its own plugins to accomplish new tasks it encounters them and
- select LLMs to use based on the Goal and Tasks and predefined criteria (accuracy, creativity, cost, etc.)

None of this code has yet been tested or run.  These are very early days.
