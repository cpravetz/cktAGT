Code Analysis

Main functionalities:
The MemoryManager class is responsible for managing memory stores and providing methods for saving, loading, and deleting tasks and agents. It loads memory stores from a directory and selects the active store based on the environment variable or defaulting to "local". It also provides a method for loading agents and their associated tasks from the active store.

Methods:
- loadMemoryStores(): loads memory stores from a directory and adds them to the memoryStores map
- save(task): saves a task to the active memory store
- load(taskId): loads a task from the active memory store
- delete(taskId): deletes a task from the active memory store
- saveAgent(agent): saves an agent to the active memory store
- loadAgent(agentId, agentManager): loads an agent and its associated tasks from the active memory store and adds them to the agentManager's taskManager

Fields:
- memoryStores: a Map object containing all loaded memory stores
- activeStore: the currently active memory store
- id: a unique identifier generated using the keyMaker module
