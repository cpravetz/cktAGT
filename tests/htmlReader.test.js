Code Analysis

Main functionalities:
The HTMLReaderPlugin class is responsible for reading the body section of any webpage. It takes a URL as an argument and returns the text of the webpage's body. It also creates a new Task object to send the HTML body to the LLM.

Methods:
- execute(agent, command, task): This method executes the command by taking an agent, command, and task as arguments. It loads the URL using Cheerio, gets the text of the webpage's body, creates a new Task object, and returns the outcome, results, and tasks.

Fields:
- version: A static field that holds the version of the plugin.
- command: A static field that holds the name of the command.
- description: A static field that holds the description of the command.
- args: A static field that holds the arguments for the command. It only has one argument, which is the URL of the webpage to read.
